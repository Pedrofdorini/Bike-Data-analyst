Data Extraction: Initially, I utilized SQL to extract the relevant information from the dataset.

Data Preparation: Following the extraction, I used Excel to perform initial data visualization and analysis.

Data Visualization: Subsequently, I exported the dataset from Excel to Tableau, where I created a more visually appealing and interactive dashboard.
